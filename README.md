## ⚠️ Notice of abandonment.

I've spent some time building Git DAO and I was serious about it, even bought
the domain for it. But looks like it is going to be one of many projects that
I need to abandon. Some of the reasons for abandoning are mentioned below.

1. Do github repositories really need DAO?
2. Is it really useful?
3. Is this idea really cool ? I mean it was when I started it but now ?
