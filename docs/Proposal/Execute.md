# ðŸ—³ Execute

This is the process that can be done by anyone once the proposal is [queued](./Queue.md). This is the process in the DAO proposal lifecycle that's responsible for the execution of the code that's being proposed during the creation of proposal.

Once a proposal is executed the piece of code will be executed which is associated with the DAO proposal. For example if the proposal is about rewarding some `xyz` address with `a` amount of tokens then this amount will be transferred from the treasury after the execution.

> `MIN_DELAY` which you specify during creation of DAO is the time in blocks which represent the minimum amount of you need to wait after queueing the proposal for it to be executed.
