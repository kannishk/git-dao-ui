# Terms

## Voting Period

It's is the time for which the voting will be active for a proposal, and it's defined in block numbers and not timestamp.
PNG supports palette-based images (with palettes of 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA colors), grayscale images (with or without an alpha channel for transparency), and full-color non-palette-based RGB or RGBA images. The PNG working group designed the format for transferring images on the Internet, not for professional-quality print graphics; therefore non-RGB color spaces such as CMYK are not supported. A PNG file contains a single image in an extensible structure of chunks, encoding the basic pixels and other information such as textual comments and integrity checks documented in RFC 2083.[7]

PNG files use the file extension PNG or png and have been assigned the MIME media type image/png.[8] PNG was published as informational RFC 2083 in March 1997 and as an ISO/IEC 15948 standard in 2004.[1]
